    " - Figure out what's the deal with the 287 NaN before combining\n",
    " - Timestamp: split into features \"date\" and \"time\"\n",
    " - Age: replace the outlier values with randomly generated values between mean +/- std\n",
    " - Gender: replace misspelled values with \"m\" and \"f\"; pool nonstandard values into \"o\" (other)\n",
    " - state: consider USA states on the level of countries since heavily skewed USA?\n",
