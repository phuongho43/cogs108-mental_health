    "Mental health is a global scale challenge confronting our culture. According to The United Nations “at any given time, its is estimated that approximately 20% of the adult population have a mental health problem” (Phyllis). This equates to nearly one and a half billion people who encounter mental health issues. Thus, we selected the overarching umbrella topic to be centered on mental health statistics. To further narrow the scope we selected stigmatization amongst employees in the tech industry given it is a potential career path for most of the members of the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, mental health is a stigmatized topic of conversation given the “prejudice against people with mental illness” (Corrigan). It’s taboo and no one likes to talk about it. With so much at stake, money, investments, reputation and more, workplace stress levels run high in today's high-functioning society. Especially in the growing trends of startup culture, the rigors of working within technology and innovation are presenting increased risk factors and symptoms towards developing conditions such as anxiety or depression. Recently deemed “Silicon Valley’s Secret,” mental health issues are appearing to have a noticeable prevalence amongst entrepreneurs and workers in the technology industry. This heightened pressure and demand for results at rapid pace has normalized an unspoken rule that categorizes these struggles in a negative light. \n",
    "\n",
    "We believe stigma will be higher amongst older adults because a study found “more negative attitudes... among those who believed that depression is a sign of personal weakness” (Jang). One assumption for this reason can be due to new studies and the classification of mental health issues as a medical condition like ADHD as opposed to an older perspective of weakness in the character of the individual. Similarly, we hypothesize males will demonstrate more stigma given previous studies showed males have less knowledge of mental health and more stigma given females are twice as much willingness to use mental health services (Chandra).\n",

    "The survey provides both national and international data. The data are non-numerical, nominal providing yes or no values, including “don’t know”, “not sure”, and “maybe”. Other qualitative data include ordinal responses from scales such as never, often, sometimes, and rarely; therefore, we would need to quantify these string values into numerical values. We would also need to identify and fill in responses that are blank. Generally, if a column or row is mostly blank then we will likely drop them from the data frame while for those with a few missing values, we might consider filling them with the median response or more likely, generate a new categorical to express how the person declined to answer since it is valuable for gauging mental health stigma.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "Before using our methods we will need to create a new feature based on existing feature. We will create a parameter for stigma by using existing features such as the questions about negative consequences and willingness to talk to their employers about it. We also would need to make sure that all values are numerical values in order to use a correlation matrix. Once the data has been cleaned and the feature for gauging stigma has been created, we will check the correlation of the other features against this stigma rating. Although most of the features appear to be categorical, histograms can be plotted for the age and timestamp column. This allows us to explore whether there are certain age bands that correlate higher with stigma rating or whether certain survey responses are more likely over time (from 2014-2016) or at certain months or hours.\n",

    "A potential confound can be variability in gender when it comes to onset and diagnosis of certain mental disorders. Some mental disorders have skewed representation in diagnosis because one gender is identified most with it. Age of onset can also play a critical role in the representation of mental disorders, as some disorders have earlier prominence than others. A bias that we face is perceiving older people as more conservative and less open about topics of mental health. Since our team is made up of college students, we are more exposed to learn about mental health issues and are surrounded by resources on campus that are open to talking about these issues. Another bias we face is not knowing about the perspective on mental health in other countries as our knowledge is limited only to the US and its views on mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other pitfalls involve the nature of the datasets. Since they are restricted to a certain interval of time (2014-2016), there are limitations to generalizing them to other time periods since this social phenomenon would likely have evolved over time. The datasets are also restricted to workers in the tech industry so another thing to note is that tech workplaces differ from other types of workplaces. Lastly, as with surveys in general, a key bias is that certain types of people are more likely to be motivated to go and fill out these surveys.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If our methods do not work we would find additional datasets to enhance the existing data and find new correlations. If we find that age, gender, and geographic location do not have any significant impact on mental health stigma we could see how quality of health care of each country can have an effect. Another potential avenue would be to use data on a different field or industry to compare how mental health is perceived in the tech field versus another field. "
